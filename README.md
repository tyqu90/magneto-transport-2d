This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (code.ipynb) for analyzing magneto-transport data in 2D materials, including:
Shubnikovâ€“de Haas (SdH) oscillations
Weak localization effects
Magnetoresistance characterization
The notebook provides a self-developed analysis pipeline to process experimental datasets, visualize results, and extract key parameters for research in condensed matter physics.

Please ensure the two following steps:
1. Put "Data", "Python_Scripts" and "code.ipynb" in the same folder
2. Update the directory for the files in "code.ipynb"
